## How to Earn Reward Points

The STRATO Rewards Program is designed to reward meaningful participation across the ecosystem. There are **ongoing rewards** for actions that help secure liquidity and stability, and **one-time rewards** for key activities.

### Ongoing Rewards

Earn continuously as long as you participate:

- **Deposit in Lending Pool** – Earn points while your USDST is deposited and helping power the lending markets.
- **Provide Liquidity to Swap Pools** – Support decentralized trading and earn rewards while you supply liquidity.
- **Mint USDST via CDP** – Create USDST using collateral, and earn points for the duration of your minted position.
- **Stake in the Safety Module** – Strengthen protocol safety and earn rewards while your USDST is staked.

### One-Time Rewards

Earn points each time you perform these actions:

- **Swap Tokens** – Every swap earns you a one-time rewards boost.
- **Borrow from Lending Pool** – Earn points the moment you take out a loan.

## Campaign Allocation

The inaugural STRATO Rewards campaign features **1,000,000 Reward Points** distributed across key ecosystem activities. Here's how the points are allocated:

| Activity | Description | Allocation | Points |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| CDP USDST Mint | Borrow USDST using collateral | 30% | 300,000 |
| Crypto Swap LP Liquidity | Supply assets to earn interest | 20% | 200,000 |
| Metals Swap LP Liquidity | Supply assets to earn interest | 20% | 200,000 |
| Lending Pool Liquidity | Lend USDST to the lending pool | 10% | 100,000 |
| Safety Module | Participate in the safety module | 10% | 100,000 |
| Lending Pool Borrow | Borrow from the lending pool | 5% | 50,000 |
| Swaps | Exchange tokens on the platform | 5% | 50,000 |

### Allocation Breakdown

```
CDP USDST Mint               ██████████████████████████████ 30%
Crypto Swap LP               ████████████████████ 20%
Metals Swap LP               ████████████████████ 20%

Lending Pool Borrow          █████ 5%
Swaps                        █████ 5%
```

The allocation reflects the strategic importance of each activity in building a robust, liquid, and secure DeFi ecosystem. Activities that provide ongoing liquidity and stability—such as minting USDST and supplying liquidity to swap pools—receive the largest share of rewards.
