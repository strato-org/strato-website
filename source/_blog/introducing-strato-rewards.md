## How to Earn Reward Points

The STRATO Rewards Program is designed to reward meaningful participation across the ecosystem. There are **ongoing rewards** for actions that help secure liquidity and stability, and **one-time rewards** for key activities.

### Ongoing Rewards

Earn continuously as long as you participate:

- **Deposit in Lending Pool** – Earn points while your USDST is deposited and helping power the lending markets.
- **Provide Liquidity to Swap Pools** – Support decentralized trading and earn rewards while you supply liquidity.
- **Mint USDST via CDP** – Create USDST using collateral, and earn points for the duration of your minted position.
- **Stake in the Safety Module** – Strengthen protocol safety and earn rewards while your USDST is staked.

### One-Time Rewards

Earn points each time you perform these actions:

- **Swap Tokens** – Every swap earns you a one-time rewards boost.
- **Borrow from Lending Pool** – Earn points the moment you take out a loan.

## Tracking Your Rewards

Monitoring your earnings is simple and designed for clarity.

Head to **Dashboard → Rewards** to:

- See your total stake and estimated daily earnings
- Track pending rewards updating in real time
- Understand how each activity is contributing to your points

Everything you need is available at a glance—no guesswork required.

## Claiming Your Rewards

Once you're ready to collect, claiming your points is fast and frictionless.

- Click **"Claim All"** to gather all available rewards
- Rewards are paid directly in **Reward Points**
- No minimum claim amount—claim as often as you like
- Enjoy complete flexibility in managing your earned value
